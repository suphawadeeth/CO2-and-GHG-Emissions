# üåç CO2 & Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
This project explores **global CO2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions**, analyzing historical trends, the impact of international agreements like the **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** and the **Paris Agreement (2015)**, and changes in emission rates over time.  

Through data analysis and visualization, this project aims to **understand emission trends**, evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies, and discuss possible solutions for reducing emissions.  

## üìä Key Features  
‚úî **Historical Emission Trends:** Analyzing CO2 & GHG emissions from the 19th century to the present.  
‚úî **Policy Impact Analysis:** Examining emissions before and after climate agreements.  
‚úî **Comparative Rate of Change:** Understanding how emissions evolved pre- and post-Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.  
‚úî **Data-Driven Insights:** Evaluating the effectiveness of global emission reduction strategies.  
‚úî **Visualizations:** Clear and insightful graphs for better understanding.

## üîé Key Findings
**CO‚ÇÇ emissions have been consistently rising** since the Industrial Revolution. 

![CO2 plot](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/glob_co2.png)

- The CO‚ÇÇ emissions have been consistently rising, especially after 1950. The increase rate is approximately 19 times higher than in the years before, with a rate of 0.45 gigatonnes per year (Gt/year).

**Cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> and Temperature Correlation**:



![Cumulative CO2 plot](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/cumulative_co2.png)

##### Observation:
- This plot reveals a strong correlation between temperature change and cumulative CO2 emissions. Notably, the increase in cumulative CO2 emissions steepens between 1975 and 2024, with the trend in temperature change following a similar pattern.

- However, information on atmospheric CO2 levels remains incomplete.

##### Further Study:
- To fully understand the situation, we need to analyze atmospheric CO2 levels alongside other greenhouse gases (GHGs), as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol (adopted in 1997 and amended in 2012). Since these gases significantly contribute to global warming and climate change, comparing their levels against global temperature changes would provide deeper insights.

**GHG Emissions Increase**:


![GHG emission plot](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/ghg_emission.png)


- The GHG emissions have been consistently rising, with an everage rate of 0.29 Gt/year.

- The dataset reveals a clear upward trend in GHG emissions over the past century, especially after the Kyoto Protocol (2005).

- Despite the Kyoto Protocol‚Äôs commitments, GHG emissions have continued to rise without any significant slowdown, indicating that current international climate policies have not been effective enough in reducing emissions globally.

___

**Kyoto Protocol's Impact**:


![Post-Kyoto](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/post_kyoto.png)

- The GHG emission rate continued to increase even after the Kyoto Protocol, reaching 0.41 Gt/year, which is approximately 1.7 times higher than the pre-Kyoto period.



**Paris Agreement and GHG Emissions**:



![Post-Paris](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/post_paris.png)

- The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 and enforced in 2016, has helped stabilize emissions. 

- However, it has yet to show any significant reduction in global GHG emissions, reinforcing the notion that stronger or different policies may be needed to tackle climate change effectively.


## üí° Next Steps
- Expand the dataset to include regional and sector-specific emissions.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future emission trends.
- Investigate emission reduction solutions for industries and governments.
