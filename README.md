# üåç CO2 & Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
This project explores **global CO2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions**, analyzing historical trends, the impact of international agreements like the **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** and the **Paris Agreement (2015)**, and changes in emission rates over time.  

Through data analysis and visualization, this project aims to **understand emission trends**, evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies, and discuss possible solutions for reducing emissions.  

## üìä Key Features  
‚úî **Historical Emission Trends:** Analyzing CO2 & GHG emissions from the 19th century to the present.  
‚úî **Policy Impact Analysis:** Examining emissions before and after climate agreements.  
‚úî **Comparative Rate of Change:** Understanding how emissions evolved pre- and post-Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.  
‚úî **Data-Driven Insights:** Evaluating the effectiveness of global emission reduction strategies.  
‚úî **Visualizations:** Clear and insightful graphs for better understanding.

## üîé Key Findings (in progress ..)
**CO‚ÇÇ emissions have been consistently rising** since the Industrial Revolution.

**Cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> and Temperature Correlation**:

**GHG Emissions Increase**:
The dataset reveals a clear upward trend in GHG emissions over the past century, especially after the Kyoto Protocol (2005).
The GHG emission rate increased post-2005 at 0.41 Gt/year, approximately 1.7 times higher than pre-2005.

**Kyoto Protocol's Impact**:
Despite the Kyoto Protocol‚Äôs commitments, GHG emissions have continued to rise without any significant slowdown, indicating that current international climate policies have not been effective enough in reducing emissions globally.

**Paris Agreement and GHG Emissions**:
The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 and enforced in 2016, has helped stabilize emissions, though this may be a delayed effect of the **Kyoto Protocol** after years of implementation. However, it has yet to show any significant reduction in global GHG emissions, reinforcing the notion that stronger or different policies may be needed to tackle climate change effectively.
