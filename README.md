# üåç CO2 & Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
This project explores **global CO2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions**, analyzing historical trends, the impact of international agreements like the **Kyoto Protocol (1997)** and the **Paris Agreement (2015)**, and changes in emission rates over time.  

Through data analysis and visualization, this project aims to **understand emission trends**, evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies, and discuss possible solutions for reducing emissions.  

## üìä Key Features  
‚úî **Historical Emission Trends:** Analyzing CO2 & GHG emissions from the 19th century to the present.  
‚úî **Policy Impact Analysis:** Examining emissions before and after climate agreements.  
‚úî **Comparative Rate of Change:** Understanding how emissions evolved pre- and post-Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement.  
‚úî **Data-Driven Insights:** Evaluating the effectiveness of global emission reduction strategies.  
‚úî **Visualizations:** Clear and insightful graphs for better understanding.

## üîé Key Findings
**CO‚ÇÇ emissions have been consistently rising** since the Industrial Revolution. 

![CO2 plot](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/glob_co2.png)

- The CO‚ÇÇ emissions have been consistently rising, especially after 1950. The increase rate is approximately 19 times higher than in the years before, with a rate of 0.45 gigatonnes per year (Gt/year).

**Cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> and Temperature Correlation**:



![Cumulative CO2 plot](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/cumulative_co2.png)

##### Observation:
- This plot reveals a strong correlation between temperature change and cumulative CO2 emissions. Notably, the increase in cumulative CO2 emissions steepens between 1975 and 2024, with the trend in temperature change following a similar pattern.

- However, information on atmospheric CO2 levels remains incomplete.

##### Further Study:
- To fully understand the situation, we need to analyze atmospheric CO2 levels alongside other greenhouse gases (GHGs), as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol (adopted in 1997 and amended in 2012). Since these gases significantly contribute to global warming and climate change, comparing their levels against global temperature changes would provide deeper insights.

**GHG Emissions Increase**:


![GHG emission plot](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/ghg_emission.png)


- The GHG emissions have been consistently rising, with an everage rate of 0.29 Gt/year.

- The dataset reveals a clear upward trend in GHG emissions over the past century, especially after the Kyoto Protocol (2005).

- Despite the Kyoto Protocol‚Äôs commitments, GHG emissions have continued to rise without any significant slowdown, indicating that current international climate policies have not been effective enough in reducing emissions globally.

___

**Kyoto Protocol's Impact**:


![Post-Kyoto](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/post_kyoto.png)

- The GHG emission rate continued to increase even after the Kyoto Protocol, reaching 0.41 Gt/year, which is approximately 1.7 times higher than the pre-Kyoto period.



**Paris Agreement's Impact**:



![Post-Paris](https://github.com/suphawadeeth/CO2-and-GHG-Emissions/blob/main/images/post_paris.png)

- The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 and enforced in 2016, has helped stabilize emissions. 

- However, it has yet to show any significant reduction in global GHG emissions, reinforcing the notion that stronger or different policies may be needed to tackle climate change effectively.

## Key Differences Between Kyoto Protocol & Paris Agreement
The Kyoto Protocol had binding commitments for developed countries only, whereas the Paris Agreement involves all countries with voluntary commitments.

**Kyoto Protocol (1997)**
üîπ Binding Emission Targets:
- Developed countries were given legally binding targets to reduce GHG emissions (collectively 5% below 1990 levels).
- Targets were set for a commitment period (2008-2012).
üîπ Differentiated Responsibility:
- Developed countries (Annex I nations) were expected to take the lead in emission reductions.
- Developing countries (non-Annex I nations) were not required to have binding reduction targets.

**Paris Agreement (2015)**
üîπ Global Participation:
- Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement includes all countries (both developed and developing) with nationally determined contributions (NDCs).
üîπ Voluntary Emission Reductions:
- Countries set their own targets for GHG reductions based on their national circumstances, capabilities, and priorities.
- No legally binding reduction targets‚Äîinstead, countries are encouraged to update their NDCs every five years and increase ambition.
### Observations:
- Despite the Kyoto Protocol's legally binding targets, GHG emissions continued to rise after its implementation.
- The Paris Agreement (effective since 2016) has helped stabilize emissions. However, it has failed to reduce emissions on a global scale.
    - This means emissions are still accumulating in the atmosphere and worsening climate change.
- Both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement have failed to achieve significant global emission reductions, indicating that current policies are not effective enough, and a better approach is needed to tackle this issue.

## üåç Conclusion & Final Thoughts
### Why Tracking CO2 and GHG Emissions is Important
- Tracking CO2 and GHG emissions is the foundation of effective management.

- Large industrial companies, partners, stakeholders, and even individuals all share the responsibility of managing emissions and mitigating their environmental impact.

- Keeping track of emissions helps us:
    - Understand company and organizational activities.
    - Identify the best methods and solutions to reduce emissions.
    - Optimize production efficiency with fewer resources.
    - Develop better global policies for a sustainable future.

### By monitoring and managing emissions, we take a crucial step toward a cleaner, more sustainable world. üå±¬∂


## üí° Next Steps
- Expand the dataset to include regional and sector-specific emissions.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future emission trends.
- Investigate emission reduction solutions for industries and governments.
